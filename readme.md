This project aims to build an end-to-end data solution to allow users to resolve enquries around weather data. <br>
An efficient database design and sufficient data governance over data quality are considered to ensure a reliable and trustworthy data product.

## Assumption
- The weather dataset from the Bureau of Meteorology is assumed to be updated every month.
- Scope of the project is limited to weather measured from 2012 onwards.

## Architecture
